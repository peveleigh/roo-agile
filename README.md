# roo-agile
Modified BMAD Method for implementation in RooCode

See https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD for the original

Usage instructions:
- Copy .roo and .roomodes to your project directory.
- Start a task with Agile Director. It will call all the other modes from start to finish and those other modes will ask you what you're looking to develop.
- You can terminate the task inbetween any of the modes and the director will pick back up with the next mode in line when you run it again.
- Consider reviewing the document(s) each mode creates and making changes as necessary before moving onto the next mode.
